I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Professor Timothy Chan. My primary research interests are in the application of optimization and analytics methods to resuscitation science.

I previously completed my Master of Applied Science and Bachelor of Applied Science degrees at the University of Toronto.
